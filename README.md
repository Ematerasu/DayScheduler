# DayScheduler
Simple web app to schedule your day.
Everything was done using Django (Python) and HTML/CSS but I mainly focused on Django. This is my first full site using this framework so any advice is appreciated.

You can check this website at https://day-scheduler.herokuapp.com 
(Warning! This is my first website hosted on heroku so I might forgot something and you might get an error, please DM me about it so I can fix it and learn as well :D)

- Add activities and delete them later if you want (just click on the name to delete it),
- Contact to author and link to this repository.
